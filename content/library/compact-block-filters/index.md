## {{< page-title >}}

**Compact Block Filters (CBF)** let [Bitcoin Safe]({{< ref "/" >}}) scan the blockchain without asking an Electrum server which addresses belong to you.

Instead of querying a central server, Bitcoin Safe downloads a small filter for each block from random Bitcoin Core peers. Your wallet checks those filters locally and only downloads full blocks when needed.

### CBF vs Electrum

### Why use CBF

- Better privacy: your wallet never asks a server about your addresses.
- No trusted indexer: Bitcoin Safe talks directly to the Bitcoin network.
- Lightweight sync: filters are small, so you do not need the full blockchain.

### What to expect

- New wallet or wallet recovery: usually takes **5 to 30 minutes** for the first sync.
- Already synced wallet: usually catches up **very fast**, often in **under 30 seconds**.
- Switching from Electrum to CBF: usually also **under 30 seconds**.

You can choose how many peers Bitcoin Safe connects to. More peers improve redundancy, but usually increase bandwidth use and sync time. The default is **2** peers.

### Unconfirmed transactions

CBF covers **confirmed blocks only**. To also get alerts for incoming unconfirmed payments, leave [Instant transaction notifications]({{< ref "library/instant-transactions-notifications/" >}}) enabled, which is the default.

### Technical note

Compact block filters are defined in [BIP158](https://bips.dev/158/). Bitcoin Safe uses the open-source [Kyoto compact block filter module for BDK](https://github.com/2140-dev/kyoto).

You can also use your own Bitcoin Core node as an initial peer in the _Bitcoin network monitoring_ settings.
